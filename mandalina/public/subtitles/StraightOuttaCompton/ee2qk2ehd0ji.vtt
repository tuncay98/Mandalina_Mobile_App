Okay.
Your ass better bring it.

- The fuck wrong with you, man?
- You better chill the fuck out.

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.759
One time.

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:20.119
Hey! We told everybody
to clear this parking lot!

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:21.680
We just standing here.

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:23.240
- Yeah, yeah.
- Get outta here!

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:25.551
- What's going on?
- Hey! Hey! Head home!

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:27.199
I fell.

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:29.397
You fell? He fell?

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.114
That's what he said.

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:36.274
I didn't ask you what he said.
Get the fuck home!

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.712
<i>I am home.</i>

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:41.951
Head home! Go!

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:47.551
If you don't start walking...

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.793
Or what?

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:53.315
Turn around. Hands on your head.

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:54.800
- Come on.
- Fuck.

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:01.473
You have the right to remain silent.

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:04.792
Stop resisting, boy!

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:30.111
- What up, sucker-punch?
- You already know what it is.

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:32.510
Sucker-punched that dude, man.

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:34.671
Hey, man, nah, nah. That was Tyree.

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.672
You know he got that temper and shit.

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:40.515
- Always getting me into fucking trouble, man.
- What they lock you up for?

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:44.515
I was literally just standing there, man.
That's it.

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:46.512
As far as they was concerned.

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:48.592
That's the gangsterist shit
I heard all week.

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:51.149
Man, it's stupid.

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:54.153
Well, I was thinking about what you was
saying last night though, man.

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:56.038
Oh, yeah?

00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:57.713
And?

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:00.557
- It's interesting.
- How long?

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:04.031
Really, like, how long do you think
that shit you doing out there gonna last?

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:07.033
'Cause it ain't no happy endings
in that game, man.

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:10.796
You saying a lot for a nigga
who just got bailed outta jail.

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:13.315
- I'm just saying, if you can slang dope...
- Nigga!

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:16.871
- What, man?
- Just tell the whole fuckin' world I sell dope.

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:20.670
Yo, yo. You can slang dope,
you can slang records, man. It's easy.

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:23.320
You got a mind for that shit, E.

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:26.478
- So what you talkin' about doing? Li'I homey from last night?
- Nah, man.

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:29.553
He in a group. You know, they a trip, but...

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:32.552
But that shit, the reality raps,

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:34.836
that's what I'm talking about, man.

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:36.320
That's it.

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:40.076
My boy, D.O.C., he coming in
from Dallas, dope.

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:42.720
- My little homey, Ren, rap too.
- Oh, yeah?

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:44.678
Hey, look, I got these cats...

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:46.831
H.B.O. Home Boys Only.

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:50.231
From New York. Dope voices, man.

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:52.670
Some wack-ass lyrics though, man.

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:57.835
I'm saying, Cube,
he wrote this shit for 'em. It's crazy.

00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:00.674
Shit, we could probably
do something with that.

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:04.037
That's what I'm saying, man.
Start a label or something, man.

00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:05.600
A label?

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:07.751
That's kinda fuckin' farfetched, Dre.

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:09.593
Yeah, but check this out.

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:12.673
What would you call
a record label like that?

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:20.354
Ruthless.

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:22.079
Ruthless?

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:26.957
- Just like these fucking police, nigga.
- Ruthless.

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:28.952
Let's get the fuck from around here.

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.952
Trying to get me sent to jail.

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:32.872
Get your simple ass in the car.

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:36.636
<i>Rap Beat]</i>

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:41.438
What the fuck is "gankin'"?
And what's a "6-4"?

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:42.874
- Yeah.
- It's a car.

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:44.474
A 6-4 Impala.

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:47.597
"Gankin'" is when you jack somebody, man.

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:50.479
It's not a big deal.
The shit just sound better.

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:53.234
Yo, man, it's too much
cursing for radio play.

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:57.758
- Besides, who gives a fuck about Compton anyway?
- Hey, hold the fuck up.

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:01.829
Hey, y'all got something
to say about Compton?

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.992
'Cause we might have
a problem up in this bitch.

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:09.270
Huh? No?

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:12.751
Then do the lyrics,
'cause I'm really losing my patience.

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:14.911
<i>A'ight? Stop fuckin' embarrassing me, man.</i>

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.754
- Hey, man. I ain't with this shit.
- Yeah, man. Fuck this shit.

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:20.480
- Fuck this Jheri curl rap bullshit, man.
- Fuck you!

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:23.280
- Wearing a Kangol don't make you LL Cool J, nigga.
- Fuck you gonna do about it?

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:26.472
- What you gonna
do, mark-ass nigga? - Hey.

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.473
Let's roll, B.

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:48.954
- B-street-lookin' motherfucker.
- Fucking Jheri curl-ass.

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:52.033
Keep talkin' that bullshit
on your way out the door, nigga.

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:02.873
- Well, there goes the talent, Dre.
- Shut the fuck up, E.

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:05.555
- I'm just sayin'.
- All right.

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:08.519
How the fuck we 'posed
to make a record label and hit records...

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:10.557
and we ain't got no talent?

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:15.635
I mean, you said hold up my side of
the deal. You said put some money up.

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:18.030
<i>So it's time for you to deliver.</i>

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:25.715
Why don't you do this shit, E?

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:29.476
Nah, for real. Get in there on the mike.
You ain't got shit to lose.

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:31.512
It's your money. You paying for it.

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:35.310
No, I can't. 'Cause I'm not a rapper.
There's your rapper.

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:38.512
I'm in a group already, man. Jinx and
them would trip on me if I do anything.

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:40.990
I understand that you wanna
keep throwing your life away...

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:43.675
with Jinx and the backyard boogie band
or whatever,

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:46.036
but I'm the Berry Gordy of this shit.

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:50.598
So, whenever y'all figure out
what y'all wanna do, just let me know.

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:53.957
<i>Come on, man.
Look, the song is about you, E.</i>

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:57.192
Eazy-motherfuckin'-E. I'm telling you.

00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:00.796
Come on, man.
You the only motherfucker with a 6-4.

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:02.917
- You got a 6-4?
- I don't have a car.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.515
- You got a 6-4?
- I got a po' Porsche, man.

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:07.876
Nigga, come on, man.

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:09.519
You ain't doing nothing.

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:15.754
But you the businessman,
so, you know, it's on you.

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:18.792
We got a cold-ass song though.

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:22.555
I think you could hit that shit.

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:26.234
I'm not sold, Dre.

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:29.313
What you mean, you not sold?
You just gonna sit there?

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:31.790
You're kinda being
a ho right now, Eric.

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:36.950
Fuck y'all niggas.

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:38.793
Berry Gordy to save the day.

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:40.639
- I ain't scared.
- You ain't scared?

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:46.155
- What are you doing?
- E, let me produce. Man.

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:50.992
- Feel like it's getting weird.
- Man, shut up and get comfortable.

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:52.594
Let's go.

00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:58.313
# Cruisin' down the street
in my 6-4 #

00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:00.636
- Shit!
- What the fuck?

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:05.991
What the fuck is so funny?

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:08.515
Nothing. Not...
Oh, E, can you hear me?

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:11.672
Yeah, I can hear you and how much
y'all fuckin' laughing.

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:13.479
- No.
- Hey, E, you good.

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:16.997
Just hit that first beat hard, man.
You gotta come in on beat.

00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:20.437
<i>Cruisin' down the street.
You cruisin'.</i>

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:22.000
- You good, Eric.

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:25.198
- No, no, no, no. You good, you good.
- It's dope.

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:26.839
But on beat.

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:28.877
Again. All right? Let's go.

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:31.634
Cruisin'. All right?

00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:39.870
# Cruisin' down the street
in my 6-4 #

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:41.872
Shit. - That ain't it.

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:43.519
It really ain't.

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:46.479
Hey, hey, Dre. He gotta go if we're gonna
do this. Cube, you gotta go.

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:49.712
- Get the fuck outta here, Yella.
- Now, nigga. Both y'all.

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:51.359
- You talking to me?
- Bye!

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:53.636
- Go, Cube! Yella, get the fuck outta here.
- Me too?

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:55.632
Yeah, so we can get this shit done.

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:58.030
"Write the song, Cube.
Shut the fuck up, Cube. "

00:30:58.120 --> 00:30:59.793
Take these with you, Cube.

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:02.196
Yella. Yes, man. Come on.

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:05.318
You know what? Whatever.
Whatever.

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:07.392
- You motherfucker.
- Come on, E.

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:11.076
You finished, Dre? You wanna laugh too?
I stay in this bitch by myself.

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:12.992
Hey, just say the words. A'ight?

00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:16.312
- What does that even mean?
- Man, just say the shit with me. All right? Cruisin'.

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:18.710

# Dre, you know this shit

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.674
A'ight, you... you trying to be funny.

00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:33.195
But you see how you said that shit, right?
Like you believe it.

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:36.273
<i>- Yeah, I believe that shit.
- Then say this shit like you believe it, man.</i>

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:40.673
Like it's a motherfuckin' Sunday and you
cruisin' down Crenshaw in a motherfuckin' 6-4.

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:43.719
Come on. Say that shit like you
believe it, man. Like it's your words.

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:47.032
Feel that shit. Stop playing
around. Loosen the fuck up.

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:50.397
<i>There you go.</i>

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:56.955
# Cruisin' down the street

00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:00.556
Oh, shit. Hey, that was dope, E.

That shit was dope, man. Yeah!

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:05.476
That's what I'm talking about, man.

00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:07.711
You feelin' that shit, right?

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:11.476
Now we only got 59 more lines to punch in.
But it's all good. We gonna get through it.

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:13.438
Let's go on to the next one.

Hey, D.O.C. What you think? You think
they gonna feel that shit in Dallas?

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:17.273
- Man, to be honest, man, that shit is super dope, nigga.
- Hell yeah!

00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:18.794
For real, nigga.

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:21.600
Hey, Lonzo. What you think?

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:25.196
Sound like some
waste-of-time shit to me.

00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:29.638
Look, this shit ain't gon' work. You ain't gon'
get no radio play with that shit right there.

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:31.632
<i>- Oh, for real?
- Oh, for very real.</i>

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:35.396
Wrap this shit up. I need you to get back
on that slow jam we talked about.

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:38.791
This whole reality rap shit y'all tryin' to do,
talkin' about low riders and jail,

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:40.792
don't nobody wanna hear that shit.

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:45.159
You need to get back in there and work on
that slow jam that we worked on. I'm serious.

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:48.153
About all you motherfuckers taking up
my time, and that's coming out your pay.

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:50.152
No disrespect, Eazy,
'cause I know you real.

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:52.550
But you, motherfucker,
I ain't gonna take that shit from you.

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:54.757
20 years from now,
you gonna fucking thank me. Watch.

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:58.834
20 years from now, you still gonna be
recording love songs in this dusty-ass garage.

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:02.072
Get the fuck outta here.

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:04.231
- Wrap this shit up.
- Get your ass out.

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:06.391
Yeah, okay. You got it.

00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:09.160
<i>No, you got it!</i>

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:13.840
- Yes!
- I told you. Didn't I tell you?

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:15.354
You told me, man.
I should've believed you.

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:18.717
What the fuck did you all get from that
that you're high-fiving and shit?

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:20.792
Cube. If Lonzo
think it ain't gonna be shit,

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:22.837
we know we got
a motherfucking hit!

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:25.389
- Exactly.
- 'Cause he don't know shit about music.

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:27.278
He don't know
good music when he hears it.

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:31.195
- Play that shit again!
- Dre, you a fucking genius.

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:32.873
You a fucking genius.

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:34.997

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:37.595

cold-shooting some hoops #

<i># A car pulls

00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:42.996

Whoo! These phones are burning up.

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:24.789
This is 1580 KDAY.

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:28.556
This is Greg Mack with the Mack Attack,
and I gotta give it up to my boy, Dr. Dre,

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:32.429
who's coming with Compton's
very own Eazy-E.

00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:34.239
And you're listening
to "Boyz-N-The-Hood",

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:38.149
<i>the number-one-requested song
for six weeks and counting.</i>

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:44.355
A'ight. Guess I'll see you soon.

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:46.511
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:49.069
I heard your record.

00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:52.039
- I'm Jerry Heller.
- Eric Wright.

00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:54.635
- Real pleasure to meet you, man.
- Same here.

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:57.474
Uh, would it...

00:35:57.560 --> 00:36:00.553
Here, let me get those for you.
Let me get those for you.

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:04.839
Would it be possible to have a word
with you for a second, Eric?

00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:06.673
About what?

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:08.433
About music.

00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:13.073
- After you.
- All right. Come on.

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:22.672
- So, I thought your album was good, man.
- Just good?

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:24.592
Mmm.

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:29.158
Hey, hey, hey, hey. No.

00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:31.311
I thought it was exceptional.

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:33.517
- Exceptional?
- Yes. Fantastic.

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:36.877
Please, just sit down.
All right? We'll start this again.

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:38.917
Come on. All right.

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:42.637
I'm... I'm gonna try this again.

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:45.320
- Okay?
- All right.

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:49.719
As a music manager, let me tell you
what I can do for you, Eric.

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:52.554
I will make you legit.

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:57.078
It seems as if I could
do something for you.

00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:59.994
I see.

00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:03.960
You think because I don't have some flashy
office, I don't know what I'm talking about?

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:07.556
I worked with Elton John.
I worked with Otis Redding.

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:12.840
Let me see.
I worked with War. I worked with Styx.

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:16.994
- I worked with...
- Have you worked with anybody this decade?

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:21.075
Okay.

00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:24.278
Let me tell you what I see here, Eric.

00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:29.711
A lot of raw talent, a lot of braggadocio.

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:31.280
Bravado.

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:33.317
But if you think anyone's
gonna talk to you,

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:35.471
you think anybody is gonna
let you in the building...

00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:39.110
where somebody might listen to you or talk
to you, you think that's gonna happen?

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:41.715
You're crazy, man. I'm sorry.

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:44.711
That is what I can do for you.

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:46.917
I can make you legit.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.437
I can get you in that building,
and I will protect you.

00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:54.673
I will block out all the noise
of this crazy fuckin' business,

00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:57.195
and we can build something big.

00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:00.830
But you gotta believe in me
the way that I believe in you,

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:02.798
the way that I believe in this.

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:06.954
Because you have a unique talent, Eric.
Very special.

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:08.713
Don't fuck around.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.390
But you know what?

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:15.674
If you can't handle it,

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:18.559
if it's too much fuckin' pressure
for you, then fine.

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:21.717
- Get outta here.
- Wait.

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:25.039
I'm listening.

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:31.557
You got more music for me?

00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:36.080
- Absolutely.
- Good.

00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:40.200
'Cause you are gonna have
to follow this up quick.

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:41.714
All right?

00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:45.476
Now, what does N.W.A stand for, huh?

00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:47.756
No Whites Allowed? Something like that?

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:49.877
Nah.

00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:53.435
Niggaz Wit Attitudes.

00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:58.359
You're fucking kidding me

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:04.752
All right. We can work with that.

00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:09.509
- Good. I like that. I like that a lot.
- You better.

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:14.553
Fantastic.

00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:16.840
Fantastic.

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:27.754
Hey, what up?

00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:43.152
- What's up, fam?
- Yeah!

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:48.680
- Hey.
- What's up, baby?

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:50.353
Dre!

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:51.954
All right. Okay.

00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:59.672
Hey, fellas, y'all got any idea why I
asked y'all to wear all black tonight?

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:01.513
'Cause we a all-star group.

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:04.240
And to be a all-star group,
we gotta look like it,

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:07.074
sound like it, dress like it.

00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:09.755
You mind tellin' me
what the fuck happened in your situation?

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:12.514
Man, kiss my ass.
This the only clean shit I had left.

00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:15.752
- That's saying a lot about how you live.
- We getting paid to wear all black?

00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:21.269
Look, I ain't lookin' out
for your ass no more, man. Put this on.

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:25.115
- Oh, shit. There go Mr. Drummond.
- Nah, nah.

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:27.920
<i>That's Mr. Furley from Three's Company.</i>

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.480
Hey, that's good, Ren.

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:33.880
Y'all finished?

00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:36.714
This man been out there
shopping our stuff around,

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:39.076
trying to get money for Ruthless.

00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:41.550
He tryin' to get us distribution.
He tryin' to get us on tour.

00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:44.553
He could probably bring some real money to
the table, so let's take this shit serious.

00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:46.074
Okay. And then what, E?

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:48.271
All he do is take 20 off the top.

00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:50.431
We cut 80, but that's how managers work.

00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:53.991
Fellas, all right. I'm sorry I'm late.
How's everybody doing?

00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:57.713
I'm gonna be honest with you.
We've had a lot of passes.

00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:00.795
Uh, people are scared of you guys.
Big time.

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:02.872
They think that you're dangerous.

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:05.395
Uh, I happen to think
that that's a good thing.

00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:07.631
These fucking guys,
they need some more convincing.

00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:11.509
They're so fucking timid.
So I invited them here to the show.

00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:15.116
So you've got to kick ass tonight.

00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:16.959
- Can you do that?
- Hell yeah.

00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:19.760
They're gonna be here.
Scare the shit out of them.

00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:23.952
Blow the fucking roof off, all right?
Have a good show.

00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:26.999
Hey, can this motherfucker Jerry Heller
bring in more pussy?

00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:29.390
'Cause that shit's worth 20%.

00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:31.119
Hey, man. But for real though.

00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:33.556
They want N.W.A?

00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:36.314
- Let's give 'em N.W.A.
- Hell yeah!

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:38.392
- A'ight?
- A'ight!

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:41.314
Let's go get this money!

00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:57.310
Now everybody say "Yeah!"

00:41:57.400 --> 00:41:58.629
Yeah!

00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:01.280

But Compton? I don't think so.

00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:10.514
Queens, maybe.

00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:14.594
Listen, if you find the next Bon Jovi,
call me, okay? Good luck.

00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:15.875

Jesus Christ!

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:37.351
You wrecked these motherfuckers
tonight, boy.

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:44.392
The stage was shaking so much, I thought
my needle's about to jump off the record!

00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:49.312
Yo, I was trippin' off them knowing
the words though. That shit was crazy!

00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:53.314
Hey, yo, I'm tellin' you,
Compton is definitely on the map, yo.

00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:55.710

00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:10.000
- Oh.

00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:11.833
Security?

00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:15.072
I don't think we gon' need no bodyguards.
We might got that covered.

00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:17.391
Yeah!

00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:20.598
But you never know
what you need until you need it.

00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:25.831
I just came here to give y'all props.

00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:27.991
Got people waitin' on me.

00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:29.554
Excuse me.

00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:32.678
Uh, okay, that was...

00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:34.433
one hell of a show.

00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:35.840
Whoo!

00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:39.749
Nice job. Very, very nice, gentlemen.
Outstanding!

00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:44.113
You kicked ass. Yeah, you did.
You definitely did.

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:48.513
Okay, uh, this is Eazy-E
and N.W.A, obviously.

00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:51.030
- Guys, this is Bryan Turner.
- How you doin', fellas?

00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:52.554
- Ice Cube.
- Oh. Pleasure.

00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:55.474
Bryan runs Priority Records,

00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:57.472
and he wants to sign you.

00:45:57.560 --> 00:45:59.916
Yeah, immediately.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.310
Look, fellas, I gotta say,
I loved the show.

00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:06.394
What you did with that crowd out there,
I mean, I've never seen anything like that.

00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:08.949
So I think, honestly,
if you all wanted to,

00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:10.952
you guys would fit perfectly
with our label.

00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:12.594
- Yes.
- That'll work!

00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:15.594
- That'll work. - Nah, nah, nah,
nah. No, it w... Hold on, man.

00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:17.911
I mean, Priority Records.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.639
I've never heard of it. What you got?

00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:23.509
Like, is it Def Jam?
Like, the Beastie Boys? You know?

00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:26.479
Run-D.M.C.?
You know what I'm saying?

00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:28.517
- Whoa, boys.
- Or is it more R & B?

00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:30.637
You know... Prince, Michael Jackson.

00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:32.951
- It's a little more...
- More that end of the spectrum.

00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:35.111
More R & B as of right now, but...

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:38.272
Yeah, we represent nothing big,
but mostly R & B.

00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:41.637
- Who dat?
- It's, uh, California Raisins.

00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:48.797
The raisins from the commercial singing
"I Heard it Through the Grapevine" and shit?

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:50.837
Yes, Cube, the little-ass raisins.

00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:52.877
That would be the one.

00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:55.031
Hear it out.
Don't get ahead of yourselves, okay?

00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:59.080
I was laughing, too, I promise.
Then I started cashing checks.

00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:04.076
So, look, uh, I gotta tell ya, those
little fuckers, they went gold last year.

00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:06.072
- Gold?
- Yeah, almost platinum.

00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:08.516
- Yeah.
- What do you say, fellas?

00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:11.399
You wanna go make a record?

00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:14.991
I mean, yeah!

<i>- Thank you, man.

All right, so look.

00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:36.600
Your rhymes ain't tight,
it ain't makin' the record.

00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:39.400
This ain't Lonzo's shit.
This the real deal. A'ight?

00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:41.199
So your shit better be dope.

00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:43.078

Yeah. That's what I'm talking about, man.

But you hear the difference, right?

00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:03.632
- Yeah, way better than the shit I came up with.
- I know.

00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:06.280
Excuse me, gentlemen.

00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:08.272
I thought you'd like to know...

00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:10.591

00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:11.875

- Contracts right here for you to sign.
- Thank you, my good man.

00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:19.479
Music keeps sounding like this,
this album is gonna be incredible.

00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:22.115
Well, you're welcome, Jerry.

00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:24.510
- Very strong lyrics too, Cube.
- Thank you, Jerry.

00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:26.796
- Very strong.
- Appreciate that, Jerry.

00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:28.837
So what's up with our contracts though?

00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:31.992
They're getting done right now.
Lawyers are drawing 'em up.

00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:35.039
Jerry on top of that.
But did you just switch all the straws?

00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:38.033
Yo, Dre. There's something outside
you need to take care of.

00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:40.117
Right now. Trust me.

00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:45.799

- We can split that.
- Cube. Right there, hush.

00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:55.391
- Not this time.
- You know what I got for you.

00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:58.951
Let me get this straight.
You gonna do this right here, right now?

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.560
What am I supposed to do? We're sleeping
in a twin bed at your auntie's house.

00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:05.997
We have a baby, Andre. You expect me
to wait for what you doin' in there?

00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:08.720
And you in the streets fuckin' around?
Are you crazy?

00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:12.191
What? I'm out here bustin' my fuckin' ass
day and fuckin' night...

00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:13.879

You gonna come up in here, talkin' about
some fuckin' bitches? Are you crazy?

00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:19.036
<i>- You don't get it.

00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:23.279
Chill out, man.

Tyra, it's gonna be okay.
All right? All right, baby?

00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:31.520

- Fuck no, man. I'm far from cool.

00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:46.875
- What happened, Dre? What she say?
- What'd you do?

00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:49.350
- Oh, shit. Here we go again.
- Oh, shit.

00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:51.631

- What we do?
- We'll find out in a minute what you did.

00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:12.314
- What's this?
- Hey, shut the fuck up.

00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:15.393
- What the fuck?
- Get your ass on the ground now.

00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:17.312
Get on the ground!

00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:20.837
On the ground?
What am I supposed to do with this?

00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:23.640

Hands behind your back.
Interlock your fingers.

There's seven of you and four of us. So sit tight and let us do our job.

00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:42.912
- Officer, I'm sorry. What is going on?
- Sir, stay right there, please.

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.469
We're trying to check these bangers,
make sure they're clean.

00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:47.916
I'm sorry.
These are not bangers. Okay?

00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:49.599
These are artists.

00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:51.353

And they're working with me
in the studio right now.

00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:59.112
Well, see, rap is not an art.

00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:00.793
- I'm sorry. Who are you?
- I'm the manager.

00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:03.793
- Well, you're wasting your time, Mr. Manager.
- You gotta be kidding me.

00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:05.473
- You're wasting your time.
- Really?

00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:09.116
These clients of yours, these rappers,
they look like gang members.

00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:12.989
You can't come down here and arrest people
just because of what they look like.

00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:15.356
What, are you crazy?
That's police harassment.

00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:20.077
- You said you're a manager, right? Not a fuckin' lawyer.
- Does that matter?

00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:23.153
You cannot come down here
and harass these guys...

00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:24.879
because they're black!

00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:26.952
- People have rights!
- Step back!

00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:31.040
I'll step back, you let them up.
Get up, guys. Come on. Eric!

00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:33.840
You don't tell them to get up.
We will decide that.

00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:37.351
You have no idea the people I know.
I'm gonna call the mayor's office.

00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:39.033
Step back.

00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:55.073

- Let's go.

00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:22.193
You's a fuckin' sellout.

00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:24.351
Shut up.

00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:26.193
Everything's fine. Okay?

00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:28.237

00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:33.871
Cube. Get inside.
Let's get back to work.

00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:36.634
You heard what your master said.

00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:54.075
- You're fuckin' disgraceful.
- Yeah.

00:53:57.240 --> 00:53:59.357

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:53.236
I said she got a motherfuckin'
dick in her mouth, nigga!

01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:56.233
- Oh, it ain't fun no more?
- The fuck y'all going?

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:59.438
Nigga, she's trying to compensate.

01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:02.558
- Wow!
- Nigga, them fat niggas was bullshit!

01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:06.831
- Punk-ass niggas, man.
- Bitch-ass niggas.

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:08.593
Y'all wild.

01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:11.957
Nigga runnin' so fast.
That shit was crazy.

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:13.952
- Tryin' to get me killed?
- Whatever.

01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:17.590
- Crazy.
- Nigga, ain't tryin' to take no bullet for no bitch.

01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:19.239
Bye, Felicia.

You're flying up

01:01:56.280 --> 01:02:00.718
R & B and hip-hop charts too. You have
any idea how many records we're selling?

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:03.872
Ruthless has arrived, Eric.
We're fucking huge.

01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:07.510

That's dope.

01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:15.996

<i>and, consequently,
violence against law enforcement.</i>

Fifteen on that!

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:23.838
- Fuck, man!
- Hey. Come on. Put that shit up.

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:28.675
Excuse me! Gentlemen, I'm sorry.

01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:32.390
- I don't mean to be the bearer
of bad news, but... - What you got?

01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:35.040
- Oh, shit.
- What's that?

01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:38.197
Motherfuckin' FBI.

01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:42.515
What the fuck?
I'm supposed to not care about this?

01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:45.354
- Wait, the FBI? They comin' after us too?
- Kind of.

01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:47.477
I mean,
what the letter say, Jerry?

01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:49.597
Uh, basically, uh...

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:51.956
"A song recorded
by the rap group N.W.A...

01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:54.356
<i>on their album
Straight Out Of Compton...</i>

01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:56.750

against law enforcement.

01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:59.036
Advocating violence
and assault is wrong,

01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:02.955
and we in the law enforcement community
take exception to such action. "

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:04.474
- Fuck that.
- Fuck that.

01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:06.040
Fuck the law enforcement community.

01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:09.033
We got freedom of speech.
What the fuck can they do to us?

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:12.511
You wanna provoke 'em and find out?
Because this is a warning, Cube.

01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:16.350
And it's about "Fuck Tha Police"
in particular, so,

01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:19.990
I think, uh, maybe we should
not play that song right now.

01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:22.879
Not play what? Fuck that, Jerry.
That's what the song is about.

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:25.475
Relax, relax. We're not giving in to anything.

01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:28.234
I just say we retire it for now.
Okay?

01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:30.835
It is a reasonably worded threat.

01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:32.559
This isn't, uh, street bullshit.

01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:35.553
This isn't the Crips and Bloods and crap.
This is the federal government.

01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:38.235
These guys can come after us
a million different ways.

01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:40.232
I don't even want to think about it.
Why provoke them?

01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:43.552
- The fuck does that mean?
- If it was the LAPD, maybe I'd be a little worried.

01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:47.031
- But we can't let them censor us, Jerry.
- I'm not advocating for censorship, Cube.

01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:52.240
Maybe none of us should be worried.
Maybe we should be happy.

01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:53.834
What you mean, E?

01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:55.912
'Cause this right here is a gift.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.391
- It's the FBI, E. What you talking about?
- This...

01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:02.240
is free publicity for N.W.A.

01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:04.835
We take this to the press
and we show them...

01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:07.992
what type of intimidation,
discrimination and harassment...

01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:09.992
that we dealing with from our government.

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:11.753
- I like that shit.
- I'm with that.

01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:13.513
My nigga, I feel you.

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:16.593
- If that's what you wanna do, then we can...
- That's what I wanna do.

01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:20.071
That's what we wanna do, Jerry.
That's it.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.912
That's what we wanna do.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.037
- Okay. Uh...
- Yeah?

01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:27.396
We good?

01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:29.790
- I hate to be the bearer of bad news...
- Mm-hmm?

01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:32.076
- But 20!
- Twenty, man!

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:33.640
- Wait a minute! That ain't 20!
- Hey, hey, hey!

01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:38.478
Shh. Let's not get thrown out
of another fuckin' hotel.

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:40.114
Good night, Jerry.

01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:43.557
- Compton's crap!
- Go back to Compton!

01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:45.950
Ain't that some shit.

01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:49.192
Speak a little truth,
and people lose their minds.

01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:50.879
This is not music!

01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:54.636
Shit, the truth is, they can do
whatever they want with 'em.

01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:57.393
They bought them motherfuckers.

01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:01.235

<i>to be unyielding and inflexible

01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:37.830
'Cause another one called me
and told me she's pregnant by you too.

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:41.391
You just gotta slow down.
You can't fuck every broad on the planet.

01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:45.676
- So now pussy a problem?
- It's gonna be a problem if you got 4,000 kids.

01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:47.399
- Right?
- Yeah.

01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:51.076
You make some money, you got all these
problems, you have to take care of 'em.

01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:54.073
It's fine.
I'll help you take care of 'em.

01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:57.278
- Hey, Cube.
- Sorry to interrupt y'all lobster brunch.

01:05:57.360 --> 01:06:00.558
But what's up, E? Where the contracts
at, man? You forgot about me?

01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:03.280
Didn't I tell you to... You know what?
Jerry, you wanna deal with this?

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:05.875
- I'm not talking to Jerry. I'm talking to you.
- That's Jerry's job.

01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:07.679
That is actually... It's my department.

01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:11.919
You're absolutely right to ask, Cube. The
contracts are being finalized as we speak.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.232
The thing is, with these attorneys,
they'll take forever.

01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:18.438
Poring over it, they'll bleed us dry.
But they're gonna get done.

01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:21.479
I wish I got paid by the hour
the way they do. You know?

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:23.392
Me too.

01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:27.759
I just want to know what's goin' on, since
I did write a lot of lyrics on this record.

01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:32.073
Everybody knows
how important you are, Cube.

01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:34.391
They do?

01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:36.551
That's what's goin' on.

01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:38.677
We just need some time, that's all.

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:44.157
Everything probably all right.

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:46.959
I must be trippin'.

01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:54.996
Shit tastes pretty good.

01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:57.593
Someday, right?

01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:02.155
- Y'all enjoy your meal.
- Okay.

01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:11.512
I'm telling you, that guy wants to be you
very frickin' badly.

01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:13.751
As if I ain't got enough
fucking problems.

01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:15.599
Excuse me. Can I get a refill.

01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:18.275
At some point, you just gotta trust somebody.

01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:20.434
You know?

01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:23.312
You gotta trust somebody.

01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:27.717
Nah, I just think
you overreacting, man.

01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:30.872
Eazy one of us, Cube. What you
thinkin' don't even make sense.

01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:33.794
What don't make sense is Eazy and Jerry
eating steak and lobster...

01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:35.997
and we eating Fatburger.

01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:37.719
Shit don't make no sense.

01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:42.033
Look, I hear you, but I think
we need to ride this wave.

01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:43.719
For real.

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:46.315
Don't be jumping to conclusions
until you know for sure.

01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:48.676
You know?

01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:55.912
It's my moms, man.

01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:16.033
Yo, Dre.

01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:17.998
What's going on?

01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:19.594
Um...

01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:23.752
Moms just called, man.

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:29.079
It's Tyree.

01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:31.713
He's dead.

01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:34.759
- What?
- No.

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:38.271
He got into a fight.
Some motherfucker broke his neck.

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:43.317
It's my little brother, man.

01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:49.557
It's my little baby bro.

01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:11.271
I never told y'all this.

01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:14.159
But when I was 12,
my sister got killed.

01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:18.719
Her own husband killed her,
then killed himself.

01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:32.390
This dope gang took my cousin too.

01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:38.631
Shot him in the trunk of a car.

01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:43.397
Fuckin' Compton, man.

01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:46.432
Come on, man, like...

01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:48.591
It's my fault, man.

01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:51.115
- This never would've happened...
- Don't talk like that.

01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:53.112
if I had him out here, man.

01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:55.351
It's my fuckin' fault.

01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:57.159
It coulda happened in another way.

01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:00.357
You can't blame yourself for that, Dre.

01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:03.877
Tyree gonna always be with you.
No matter what.

01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:05.599
- Yeah.
- That's right.

01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:08.360
- Yeah, for real, man.
- And we always gon' be with you.

01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:10.193
- Hell yeah.
- That's for damn sure.

01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:11.794
We always gon' be brothers.

01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:14.190
Fuck!

01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:16.272
Shh.

01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:18.317
We here. All right?

01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:19.999
- I'm sorry, man.
- You good, Dre.

01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:22.231
We all here together.

01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:28.314
<i>This is not on you, Andre.</i>

01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:32.952
If I had just brought him
on tour with me, like he wanted.

01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:35.072
Stop this nonsense now. Stop it.

01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:38.516
Your brother looked up to you,

01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:40.193
and you took great care of him.

01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:42.511
We both did.

01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:45.957
It's time to let someone else
take care of him now.

01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:00.758
I'm proud of you.

will not be permitted.

01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:51.757
Refusal to abide by all
the Detroit city ordinances...

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:55.356
will result in immediate arrest
and forfeiture. "

01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:00.158
Are we finished here?
We got a show to do.

01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:05.632
Just watch yourself.

01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:10.472
Eat a dick.

01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:13.437
It's "Fuck tha Police. "

01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:16.672
# Straight outta Compton is a brother
that'll smother your mother #

01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:18.160
# And make your sister
think I love her #

01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:20.596
# Dangerous muthafucka
raising hell #

01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:22.433
# And if I ever get caught
I make bail #

01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:24.512
# So what about the bitch
who got shot? #

01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:26.159
# Fuck her
You think I give a damn about a bitch? #

01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:27.435
# I ain't a sucker #

01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:30.115
# This is the autobiography
of the E #

01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:31.754
# And if you ever
fuck with me #

01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:34.912
# You'll get taken
by a stupid dope brother who will smother #

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.276
# Word to the muthafucka
Straight outta Compton #

01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:39.431
# Compton, Compton, Compton ##

01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:46.112
Eazy! Eazy! Eazy! Eazy!

01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:50.672
Eazy! Eazy! Eazy! Eazy!

01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:52.473
Eazy! Eazy!

01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:55.314
Damn, that shit was dope!

01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:10.960
What's up?

01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:12.793
Let's do this shit.

01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:14.314
- What's up?
- Let's do this shit.

01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:16.960
- What's up? Let's go.
- What's up?

01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:23.554
Hey, hold on, hold on.

01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:27.316
Y'all know what the motherfuckin' police
tried to tell us backstage?

01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:29.232
What?

01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:32.552
They tried to tell us
what the fuck we can't play.

01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:38.233
Motherfuckers tryin' to tell us...

01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:40.391
what the fuck we can't say.

01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:46.672
This N.W.A!

01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:50.671
We do what the fuck we wanna do.

01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:53.559
We say what the fuck we wanna say!

01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:56.513
So everybody...

01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:59.274
put them middle fingers high in the sky.

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:04.558
And to the punk-ass cop backstage...

01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:21.036
- Yo, Dre.
- What up?

01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:22.873
I got somethin' to say.

01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:27.756
# Fuck the police
Comin' straight from the underground #

01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:30.196
# A young nigga got it bad
'cause I'm brown #

01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:32.317
# And not the other color
so police think #

01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:35.552
# They have the authority
to kill a minority #

01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:37.120
# Fuck that shit
'cause I ain't the one #

01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:39.277
# For a punk muthafucka
with a badge and a gun #

01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:41.636
# To be beaten on
and thrown in jail #

01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:44.554
# We can go toe to toe
in the middle of a cell #

01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:47.314
# Fuckin' with me
'cause I'm a teenager #

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:49.710
# With a little bit of gold
and a pager #

01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:51.837
# Searching my car,
looking for the product #

01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:54.560
# Thinking every nigga
is selling narcotics #

01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:56.916
# You'd rather see me
in the pen #

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.276
# Than me and Lorenzo
rolling in a Benzo #

01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:01.317
# Beat a police out of shape #

01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:02.629
- # Then when I'm finished #
- What up?

01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:03.915
# Bring the yellow tape #

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.515
# To tape off the scene
of the slaughter #

01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:09.069
# Still gettin' swoll
off bread and water #

01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:11.470
# I don't know
if they fags or what #

01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:13.313
# Search a nigga down
and grabbin' his nuts #

01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:16.518
# And on the other hand,
without a gun, they can't get none #

01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:18.956
# But don't let it be
a black and a white one #

01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:20.997
# 'Cause they'll slam ya down
to the street top #

01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:23.840
# Black police showin' out
for the white cop #

01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:25.320
# Ice Cube will swarm #

01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:28.313
# On any muthafucka
in a blue uniform #

01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:30.631
# Just 'cause
I'm from the CPT #

01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:33.360
# Punk police
are afraid of me, huh #

01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:34.954
# A young nigga
on the warpath #

01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:38.351
# And when I'm finished,
it's gonna be a bloodbath #

01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:41.274
# Of cops dyin' in LA #

01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:43.272
# Yo, Dre, I got
somethin' to say #

01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:44.635
# Fuck the police #

01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:46.871
# Fuck, fuck
Fuck the police #

01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:49.520
# Fuck the police #

01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:52.479
# Fuck, fuck
Fuck the police ##

01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:54.472
Fuck!

01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:56.631
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
- Run! Get in the bus!

01:15:56.720 --> 01:15:58.473
Hell! They shootin'! Let's go!

01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:03.715
Go, go! All units, move in!

01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:10.239
- Move! Move!
- Go, go, go, go!

01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:11.993
- Come on! Go!
- Let's move!

01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:14.914
Let's go, man!
Let's go! Let's go!

01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:19.152
- Come on, Yella! Hurry up! Hurry up!
- Let's go! Let's go!

01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:20.640
- Fuck this!
- Come on!

01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:23.719
- Shit! Fuck!
- Shit, shit, shit!

01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:26.759
- What we gonna do?
- Come on!

01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:29.878
Get off me!

01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:41.191
Backup! We need backup
in the loading area!

01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:44.595
Now!

01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:50.193
Come on! Get the fuck off me, man!

01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:52.954
- Fuck all y'all!
- You got a Taser?

01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:56.511
This is completely fucking illegal!
You realize that?

01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:58.512
- Let us go!
- Let me go!

01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:00.193
- Come on, man!
- Fuck you!

01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:01.953
- Come on!
- Eazy-E!

01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:03.520
- Fuck you! Fuck you!
- Get in there!

01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:05.557
- All right!
- Fuck you!

01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:08.036
Fuck the police! Fuck the police!

01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:10.555
Fuck the police! Fuck the police!

01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:14.270
Fuck your mama.
Fuck your daddy. Fuck your grandma!

01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:20.874
These motherfuckers.

01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:24.713
Fuck all this!

01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:27.440
No, fuck y'all! Fuck y'all!

01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:40.038
Fuck the police!

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:46.232
How do you explain inciting a riot in Detroit?
What do you have to say about that?

01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:49.438
I have to say that, uh,
we didn't incite that shit.

01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:52.917
Right. Y'all just got a snapshot
of how Americans really feel.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.310
We gave the people a voice.

01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:57.909
We gave the people truth.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:02.677
Yeah, but your songs, they glamorize
the lifestyle of gangs, guns, drugs.

01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:05.639
Our art is a reflection of our reality.

01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:07.598
<i>What you see
when you go outside your door?</i>

01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:09.911
- I know what I see.
- And it ain't glamorous.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:13.596
We get AKs from Russia
and cocaine from Colombia.

01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:16.957
- And ain't none of us got a passport, so...
- Yeah.

01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:19.839
- Might wanna check the source.
- Next question.

01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:22.833
Will you be more careful about
what you say, how you say it?

01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:24.434
- No.
- Probably not, no.

01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:28.116
Freedom of speech
includes rap music, right?

01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:31.830
Well, we exercising our First Amendment
as far as I'm concerned.

01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:34.116
And the government wrote that.

01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:38.717
So, Cube, what's a guy from Compton do
when he starts making real money like this?

01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:46.353
Cube?

01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:49.396
Buy Raider gear.

01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:52.314
And curl activator.

01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:54.551
Next question.

01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:11.039
Good to see you, Cube.

01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:13.396
I can barely see you, Jerry.

01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:15.995
<i>What's with all the Godfather shit?</i>

01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:19.433
Okay.

01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:21.830
I know that you've been very eager...

01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:25.277
to sign a contract with Eric's company,
Ruthless Records.

01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:27.511
Eric's company?
Ain't it your company too?

01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:31.196
That's incorrect.
It's not my company. I work for you.

01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:32.999
- You work for me?
- Uh-huh.

01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:35.271
I've made that clear from the beginning.

01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:38.273
All right, cool. So I could take this
to a lawyer or somebody, right?

01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:40.397
Cube, those guys are paid to make trouble.

01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:43.393
They're gonna create problems
where no problems exist.

01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:46.791
Jerry, you know I don't know what
none of this legal shit mean. All right?

01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:50.032
None of us do. We're gonna need a lawyer
before we sign anything.

01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:52.396
Everybody else has already signed.

01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:55.633
I thought you knew this.

01:19:55.720 --> 01:19:58.110
You're the only one who hasn't.

01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:05.112
There's also this.

01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:08.472
$75,000.

01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:13.154
Shit.

01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:14.754
Sign the contract...

01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:16.957
and all this money is yours.

01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:19.993
That's my money anyway, Jerry.
I earned that money.

01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:22.151
- Now, I wrote a lot of hit songs.
- Mm-hmm.

01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:26.154
We've been performing on this tour for
months... sellin' out shows, sellin' records.

01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:29.119
- I know it's plenty of money.
- Really?

01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:31.237
Jesus Christ.

01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:34.233
- Give me my money, Jerry.
- How the hell do you think this works?

01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:37.996
How the hell do you think
all of this gets paid for?

01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:40.754
The hotel rooms, the tour buses,

01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:44.038
security, the parties, all this shit.

01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:47.232
- How do you think it gets paid for? You think it's free?
- Why are you doing this now?

01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:51.115
If we were so good, why didn't you give us
contracts in the beginning?

01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:54.438
Because nothing is a sure thing, Cube.

01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:58.309
Even a great talent can crash and burn.

01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:03.439
Too much ego, too much excess,

01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:05.352
too many expectations.

01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:08.679
It tends to ruin things.

01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:10.951
You ought to keep that in mind.

01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:20.996
This Eric's company, right?

01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:27.794
Bye, Jerry.
I'm out.

01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:56.391
What up, big Suge?

01:21:56.480 --> 01:21:58.358
- Here you go.
- Thank you, sir.

01:21:58.440 --> 01:21:59.999
Coming up.

01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:02.311
Hey, what up
with D.O.C. and Suge? Hmm?

01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:05.677
I guess that dude
is gonna be managing him now.

01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:10.073
One day you Bobby Brown's bodyguard,
and the next day you reppin' talent.

01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:11.753
Come on, man.

01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:14.912
- I guess everybody wanna get into the act, huh?
- I guess so.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:16.832
All right, man.

01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:22.672
I know, right?

01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:24.956
- How you doin'? You good?
- Here you go.

01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:27.236
I'm helping you out all I can.
You all right?

01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:28.436
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I'm good.

01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:30.034
What's going on?

01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:33.955
You hungry? Yeah?

01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:36.111
I'll be there in a minute.
All right?

01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:37.714
Thanks, man.

01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:40.440
- Thanks for everything, bruh.
- You bet.

01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:44.116
So, Cube, we gonna keep
this momentum going or what?

01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:46.635
Nah, man. Not like this.

01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:49.235
I'd rather be broke than to get fucked.

01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:51.198
I told you not to sign that shit, Dre.

01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:54.398
Nigga, I got bills to pay.
And you know that.

01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:57.951
And I gotta put some money in my
mama's hand after Tyree passed, man.

01:22:58.040 --> 01:22:59.554

I'm about to get out of here.

01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:22.879
- Take care of yourself, Dre.
- Peace.

01:23:34.680 --> 01:23:37.878
- Mom.
- I missed you.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:42.514

01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:45.714
All right.

01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:47.598
- So, you're leaving the group?
- Yeah, I'm through with the bullshit.

01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:49.359
- So, you're leaving the group?
- Yeah, I'm through with the bullshit.

01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:53.593
Eazy put everything on Jerry.
Jerry put everything on Eazy.

01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:56.115
It's a two-man show up there.
Ain't no fuckin' group.

01:23:56.200 --> 01:23:59.113
I get that, but I just
want you to understand...

01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:02.876
that you are walking away
from a winning situation.

01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:05.794
Now, how do you feel about this, Kim?
Is he making a big mistake?

01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:07.030
- A mistake?
- Yes.

01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:08.634
I don't think so, okay?

01:24:08.720 --> 01:24:10.757
After hearing all the stuff
that he went through, I would've left too.

01:24:10.840 --> 01:24:13.799
Look, I want you
to express yourself, Cube,

01:24:13.880 --> 01:24:15.712
and I am your biggest fan.

01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:18.634
I believe in you,
but I just want you to understand...

01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:21.076
there's not a lot of money
in this solo play.

01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:22.554
Okay?

01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:24.279
But if the first record hits,

01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:26.636
I will make it up to you

Maybe... Maybe some of your people
can look into my paperwork too.

01:32:40.040 --> 01:32:41.520
Most definitely.

01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:43.512
I'll arrange.

01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:45.239
Go see your boy.

01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:57.156
This place is nice.

01:32:57.240 --> 01:33:01.154
You're nice. I figured
I'd take you to a nice place,

01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:03.755
Ms. Record Executive.

01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:05.877
Record Executive Assistant.

01:33:05.960 --> 01:33:08.191
But, damn.

01:33:08.280 --> 01:33:11.876
I didn't realize we was going on
like a "date" date.

01:33:12.560 --> 01:33:14.040
I don't even know how to take that.

01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:17.909
I got my collared shirt on.
I brought you to this nice restaurant.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:21.437
That is not the kind of collared shirt
they was talking about.

01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:25.753
It's cute, though. And you didn't take off
your hat like they asked you to.

01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:27.593
- And I'm not.
- Oh, really?

01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:29.512
I ain't taking off my hat for nobody.

01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:32.832
- I think they know that.
- So what?

01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:35.915
You bring all your little females here,
don't you?

01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:38.360
The special ones.

01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:42.320
Okay.

01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:47.119
I'm playing. I'm playing.
There you go getting sensitive.

01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:49.431
You don't have to try to impress me.

01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:51.711
We could've went to Fatburger.

01:33:52.200 --> 01:33:54.476
Go to Fatburger?

01:33:54.680 --> 01:33:58.071
Hey. You got a haircut.
I love it.

01:33:58.160 --> 01:34:01.995
- How's that new house treating you?
- It's great. Thanks for asking.

01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:05.517
So, uh, how you liking
your new decor?

01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:08.479
Great. Yeah, I never did like
the old design anyway, you know?

01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:12.110
What you got for me, Bryan? I know
you called me up here for somethin'.

01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:16.398
Yeah.

First thing we're gonna do...
sue this ignorant fuck.

That's what we're gonna do. Defamation
of character, libel. I don't really care.

You got your way of dealing with it.
I got mine.

01:42:20.640 --> 01:42:23.030
I thought all this shit
was in the past, Dre.

01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:29.233
This some real shit, man. And the shit
been happening since the beginning.

01:42:29.320 --> 01:42:32.870
I had some people look into this.
I ain't been gettin' my fair share.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:34.559
Do you even know
why you rich though?

01:42:34.640 --> 01:42:36.632
Do you know
why you got a big-ass house...

01:42:36.720 --> 01:42:38.712
and you ain't sleepin'
on your auntie couch no more?

01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:41.315
Because Jerry made that possible for us.

01:42:41.400 --> 01:42:44.438
He kicked down the door
for that shit to happen. For us.

01:42:44.520 --> 01:42:46.989
And you just gonna turn your back on him?
What, you Cube now?

01:42:47.080 --> 01:42:49.754
Cube was right, fool.

01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:53.754
E, look at the papers, man, and you'll
see what the fuck I'm talkin' about.

01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:57.914
And forget about Jerry, man!
You keep talking about Jerry this, Jerry that.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:01.596
We didn't make it because of Jerry.
We made it because our shit is dope.

01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:05.677
And we can keep going, E.

01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:09.640
We can own the goddamn world, but we
just can't be fucking with him no more.

01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:14.514
Man, we started this N.W.A shit.

01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:18.599
I just want it to be right.

01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:21.195
And this what you think right?

01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:25.200
Turnin' your back on somebody
after all he done for us.

01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:28.034
You mean all he done for you.

01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:30.634
Right?

01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:33.600
Look at me.

01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:37.554
Look at me.

01:43:41.720 --> 01:43:43.677
When Tyree died,

01:43:45.800 --> 01:43:48.872
you said we was always gonna be brothers.

01:43:49.960 --> 01:43:51.917
But I guess you forgot about that.

01:43:54.760 --> 01:43:58.310
I'm-a start my own company
with Suge Knight, E.

01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:13.752
Thought we were brothers, man.

01:44:17.320 --> 01:44:19.676
<i>- I think he's Five-O.
- # I can feel it #</i>

01:44:29.480 --> 01:44:32.234

night I get in some shit #</i>

01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:35.119

01:44:39.960 --> 01:44:41.917
What up, Dre?

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:45.198
- This Death Row. We about to do this shit.
- That's what I'm talkin' about.

01:44:45.280 --> 01:44:48.239
<i># With the swiftness
So get it right with the quickness #</i>

01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:49.913
<i># And let me handle
my business, yo #</i>

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:53.880
<i>- # I'm on a mission and my mission won't stop #
- This shit sound good.</i>

01:44:53.960 --> 01:44:58.591
Yeah. None of it means anything
while I'm under contract with Ruthless.

01:44:58.680 --> 01:45:00.637
I told you about that.

01:45:00.720 --> 01:45:03.474
I'm gonna get you out of
your contracts, I promise you.

01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:06.320
Yeah, all right.

01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:13.959
What up with you, cuz?

01:45:14.040 --> 01:45:15.633
What up?

01:45:15.720 --> 01:45:18.440
- What up, lo?
- What up, Dre?

01:45:18.520 --> 01:45:20.079
- What's up, Warren?
- Chillin', man.

01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:21.753
- You good?
- I'm great. You good?

01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:23.479
- All right.
- Dr. Dre.

01:45:23.560 --> 01:45:25.279
- What's up?
- What up with you?

01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:27.397
- What's goin' on, man?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:30.075
So, look, I listened to your demo.

01:45:30.760 --> 01:45:32.240
It was tight.

01:45:33.720 --> 01:45:36.076
- You see that little look he gave me?
- Yeah.

01:45:36.160 --> 01:45:38.072
Yo, yo, yo. Hold up.

01:45:38.160 --> 01:45:39.674
Who the fuck is this guy?

01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:42.594
Oh, my bad, Suge. This the homey Snoop.

01:45:42.680 --> 01:45:45.115
Snoop D-O-double-G, cuz.
Who you?

01:45:45.200 --> 01:45:46.998
- What?
- What the fuck you say, blood?

01:45:47.080 --> 01:45:51.518
Ho, ho! Hey, hey! Hold on. Hold on.
He with me. He with me.

01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:53.273
He ain't with me.

01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:54.840
Nah. He's here to work, all right?

01:45:54.920 --> 01:45:56.991
This is business, Suge.
Come on, man.

01:45:57.120 --> 01:45:59.840
Anyway, what's this you
workin' on, cuz? I like this.

01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:03.152
So look, you know,
it's a new track for this new movie.

01:46:03.240 --> 01:46:04.674
It's called "Deep Cover. "

01:46:04.760 --> 01:46:08.037
Ooh. Ooh-wee. It's for a movie, huh?

01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:11.272
- Yeah, a movie, man.
- Dre doing big shit. Okay, okay, okay.

01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:13.636
You think you can get down on it?

01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:16.992
Oh, most definitely.
Throw me... Throw me in the booth.

01:46:17.080 --> 01:46:18.719
All right.

01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:20.359
<i># Chill
Let's hit a deal #</i>

01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:23.751
<i># If it ain't up to what you feel
then grab your steel ##</i>

01:46:23.880 --> 01:46:28.033
<i>It's perhaps the most notorious
police brutality case in recent memory.</i>

01:46:28.120 --> 01:46:31.716
<i>Those blows from Officer
Powell and Officer Wind's batons...</i>

01:46:31.800 --> 01:46:37.034
<i>continued and continued
for no just reason.</i>

01:46:37.160 --> 01:46:40.790
They just let them people do
whatever the hell they want.

01:46:40.880 --> 01:46:43.315
<i>Rodney King's leg
and facial bones were broken.</i>

01:46:43.400 --> 01:46:45.631
<i>Three of the four
accused officers took the stand...</i>

01:46:45.720 --> 01:46:47.677
<i>and admitted that it was brutal,</i>

01:46:47.760 --> 01:46:50.559
<i>but said police work is brutal
and that the videotape...</i>

01:46:50.640 --> 01:46:51.630
Here.

01:46:51.720 --> 01:46:53.837
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

01:46:53.920 --> 01:46:55.320
You watchin' this shit upstairs?

01:46:55.400 --> 01:46:57.756
<i>- Hello?
- Yo, it's Suge.</i>

01:46:57.840 --> 01:46:59.672
<i>We gotta talk about these contracts.</i>

01:46:59.760 --> 01:47:01.717
Why you don't talk to Jerry
about that shit?

01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:03.314
<i>I don't wanna talk to Jerry.</i>

01:47:03.400 --> 01:47:05.676
<i>It's your company. You the man.</i>

01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:07.433
All right.

01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:09.079
Whatever, man.

01:47:09.160 --> 01:47:10.992
I'll be through there.

01:47:12.480 --> 01:47:14.676
<i>He had it in a power swing,
and he...</i>

01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:16.558
- Who was that?
- Nobody.

01:47:16.640 --> 01:47:18.199
<i>...right across the top
of the cheekbone,</i>

01:47:18.280 --> 01:47:20.590
<i>splitting his face
from the top of his ear to his chin.</i>

01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:29.553
Where Dre at?

01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:33.918
- You said he was gonna be here.
- I'll get with you outside.

01:47:34.680 --> 01:47:36.751
Don't worry about Dre.

01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:40.078
Truth be told,
he got nothin' to do with this.

01:47:46.360 --> 01:47:48.033
This what's gonna happen.

01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:51.113
You gonna sign these,

01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:53.715
releasing Dre and D.O.C. from Ruthless.

01:47:58.480 --> 01:47:59.960
Whatever, homey.

01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:06.473
You think I'm signing that,
you crazier than I thought you was.

01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:08.074
I'm out.

01:48:11.920 --> 01:48:14.310
Get your ass up.

01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:17.552
Nah. I think you're
gonna stay here for a while.

01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:19.836
Fuck you, Suge!

01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:21.752
Y'all niggas don't scare me.

01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:24.400
You can talk tough all you want,

01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:26.597
but this ain't no record.

01:48:26.680 --> 01:48:28.558
Don't make me change you, Eric.

01:48:28.640 --> 01:48:30.233
Fuck that's supposed to mean?

01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:32.676
Keep talkin'. You're gonna
fuck around and get smoked.

01:48:32.760 --> 01:48:35.753
Nah, nah. But you better choose right.

01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:38.071
You know where the fuck I'm from.

01:48:38.160 --> 01:48:40.436
This Bompton, nigga.

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.356
Oh, my fucking God.

01:49:09.440 --> 01:49:12.797
Eric. Jesus Christ.

01:49:13.400 --> 01:49:16.518
What the hell are you doing here?
You can't sneak in here like that.

01:49:17.960 --> 01:49:19.599
I thought you were...

01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:24.669
Oh, my God. What's going on, man?
Are you okay?

01:49:25.840 --> 01:49:27.797
What happened to your face?

01:49:27.880 --> 01:49:30.554
I gotta kill this motherfucker
Suge Knight.

01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:36.553
I just came here to let you know,
'cause shit might get a little thick.

01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:38.836
I need to stay protected.

01:49:39.880 --> 01:49:43.112
No, you're not gonna do that. No.

01:49:43.200 --> 01:49:45.396
I didn't come here to ask for permission.

01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:48.234
I came here to let you know.

01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:51.950
You wanted to be involved with
this gangster shit? Here we go.

01:49:52.040 --> 01:49:56.512
You do that, and you're gonna ruin
everything we've worked for.

01:49:58.160 --> 01:50:02.279
You really think I got a fucking choice?
Look at my face!

01:50:04.040 --> 01:50:06.839
This the streets.
Motherfuckers came at me!

01:50:06.920 --> 01:50:09.151
Came at us!

01:50:09.240 --> 01:50:11.197
If I don't hit back, we finished.
It's over.

01:50:11.280 --> 01:50:13.078
I'm not saying that we're not
gonna hit back.

01:50:13.160 --> 01:50:15.117
But this is not Compton...

01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:17.953
if you haven't looked around.

01:50:18.040 --> 01:50:20.509
Drop that shit, okay?

01:50:20.600 --> 01:50:23.798
We don't hit back with bullets.
We hit back with lawyers.

01:50:23.880 --> 01:50:26.952
We drain these assholes.
That really takes 'em down.

01:50:27.040 --> 01:50:29.953
It ain't about the money, Jerry.

01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:33.112
- I don't care about no money.
- Of course it is.

01:50:33.200 --> 01:50:35.317
And you should fucking care
about the money.

01:50:36.640 --> 01:50:39.394
You're so much smarter
than these fucking thugs.

01:50:39.480 --> 01:50:42.871
You wanna kill somebody?
You're gonna go to jail forever.

01:50:45.920 --> 01:50:48.640
No more family, no more Ruthless,
no more anything.

01:50:48.720 --> 01:50:50.677
If you kill this man,
his problems will be over,

01:50:50.760 --> 01:50:53.320
and yours will just be beginning.

01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:55.392
Don't be a fucking fool.

01:50:56.240 --> 01:50:57.720
Hey.

01:50:58.960 --> 01:51:01.714
Why the fuck I gotta be the bigger man?

01:51:02.400 --> 01:51:04.437
'Cause it's better
than you being a dead man.

01:51:04.600 --> 01:51:07.195
I don't want you fucking dead.

01:51:45.280 --> 01:51:46.999
You okay?

01:51:53.640 --> 01:51:55.199
Let me see.

01:53:04.960 --> 01:53:07.714
- Why you so tense, Dre?
- No, I'm cool.

01:53:08.280 --> 01:53:11.796
Man. No, you're not, man. You've been
in that house, what? A month now?

01:53:11.880 --> 01:53:14.554
Nigga, and not one track?
I mean, what's up?

01:53:14.680 --> 01:53:16.637
There's too much interference.

01:53:16.720 --> 01:53:19.360
Man, you know how they
tryin' to starve me out.

01:53:19.440 --> 01:53:21.477
Playin' games
with my motherfuckin' money, man.

01:53:21.560 --> 01:53:24.120
That's why the house was
so goddamned empty.

01:53:25.560 --> 01:53:28.553
- Hey, come on, man.
- I'm fucking with you, cuz. Hit this.

01:53:28.640 --> 01:53:31.553
- All right, man, give me that shit.
- Here it is.

01:53:31.640 --> 01:53:33.950
Fuck I'm taking about.

01:53:34.040 --> 01:53:36.430
How you feeling righteously together.

01:53:38.800 --> 01:53:40.473
- Holy shit.
- Oh, hell no.

01:53:40.560 --> 01:53:44.474
Goddamn, man!
What the fuck is in this shit, Snoops?

01:53:44.560 --> 01:53:48.076
- That right there, that's that Chronic, cuz.
- Yeah.

01:53:49.320 --> 01:53:51.152
- Chronic.
- Yes, sir.

01:53:51.240 --> 01:53:53.152
- Let me hit that once.
- Yeah.

01:53:53.240 --> 01:53:54.879
- Look it.
- Wow, man.

01:53:54.960 --> 01:53:56.440
Let me hit that once, man. Damn.

01:53:56.520 --> 01:53:59.797
- All right. Let's head back to the studio.
- Let's go.

01:53:59.880 --> 01:54:01.394
I got something for this.

01:54:23.040 --> 01:54:25.999
Damn, Dre. What the fuck is that?
Feelin' that shit.

01:54:26.080 --> 01:54:27.560
- Yeah, you feelin' it?
- Yeah!

01:54:27.640 --> 01:54:29.836
- Hey, hey, look, I'm gonna spit a little something.
- All right.

01:54:29.920 --> 01:54:32.151
You feel me? You say whatever...
You just jump in, nigga, and just...

01:54:32.240 --> 01:54:34.277
Hold on.
Look, I got something. Here we go.

01:54:35.560 --> 01:54:38.120
# One, two, three
and to the four #

01:54:38.200 --> 01:54:40.635
# Snoop Doggy Dogg
and Dr. Dre is at the door #

01:54:40.720 --> 01:54:42.837
# Ready to make an entrance,
so back on up #

01:54:42.920 --> 01:54:44.752
# 'Cause you know
we about to rip shit up #

01:54:44.840 --> 01:54:47.753
# Gimme the microphone first
so I could bust like a bubble #

01:54:47.840 --> 01:54:49.991
# Compton and Long Beach together
Now you know you in trouble #

01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:53.152
- Uh-huh.
- # Ain't nuthin' but a "G" thang, baby #

01:54:53.280 --> 01:54:55.749
- # Two loc'ed out niggas, so we're crazy #
- Uh-huh.

01:54:55.840 --> 01:54:58.435
# Death Row is the label
that pays me #

01:54:58.520 --> 01:55:00.910
- # Un-fadable, so please
don't try and fade this # - Ooh!

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:04.152
# But back
to the lecture at hand ##

01:55:04.240 --> 01:55:06.596
I want to thank
you for having us here.

01:55:06.680 --> 01:55:09.115
- Of course.
- Very generous for you to give of your time...

01:55:09.200 --> 01:55:11.510
with, uh, everything
that's going on right now.

01:55:11.600 --> 01:55:13.114
Not a problem.

01:55:13.200 --> 01:55:14.759
Now, if I may...

01:55:15.920 --> 01:55:18.355
Are you anti-Semitic?

01:55:18.440 --> 01:55:20.955
Now, I thought this was about
the Rodney King trial.

01:55:21.040 --> 01:55:23.271
Well, the JDL recently got involved,

01:55:23.360 --> 01:55:26.034
citing the lyrics
about your former manager, Jerry Heller.

01:55:26.120 --> 01:55:27.713
I'm not anti-Semitic.

01:55:27.800 --> 01:55:30.793
I'm anti-Jerry Heller.
Let me ask you something.

01:55:30.880 --> 01:55:34.669
Do the JDL condone Jerry's behavior
when it comes to my situation?

01:55:34.760 --> 01:55:38.117
Him trying to get me to sign a contract
without legal representation?

01:55:38.240 --> 01:55:40.800
- I have no idea.
- I didn't think you did.

01:55:40.880 --> 01:55:43.554
But when you got that for me,
we can continue on this topic.

01:55:43.640 --> 01:55:48.920
Until then, I'm here to talk about the beating
of an unarmed motorist, Rodney King,

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.469
and four guilty LAPD officers...

01:55:51.560 --> 01:55:54.394
who seem to be Daryl Gates's
standard issue.

01:55:55.640 --> 01:55:57.757
It's also the LAPD and the FBI...

01:55:57.840 --> 01:56:00.719
who feel that your negative portrayal
of police condones violence.

01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:03.759
"Fuck tha Police" is
just a warning, that's it.

01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:07.311
You can't treat people like that
and expect 'em not to rise up.

01:56:07.400 --> 01:56:09.551
I'm a journalist just like you...

01:56:09.640 --> 01:56:11.552
reporting what's goin' on
in the hood.

01:56:11.640 --> 01:56:14.678
The only thing that's different
is that I'm brutally honest.

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.231
And what's your relationship
with the Nation of Islam?

01:56:20.520 --> 01:56:22.193
They my brothers.

01:56:22.280 --> 01:56:24.272
You know what?
That question right there proves to me...

01:56:24.360 --> 01:56:27.194
what kind of a unprepared
sandbag reporter you are.

01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:29.272
You talkin' to me like I'm some
elected official,

01:56:29.360 --> 01:56:31.352
like I'm running for office.

01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:33.272
But I get it. That's your job.

01:56:33.360 --> 01:56:35.875
Bigger the story, the bigger the check
in your field of work.

01:56:35.960 --> 01:56:37.872
It's not your fault.
I shouldn't blame you.

01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:41.156
- What's your name, man?
- Brian.

01:56:41.240 --> 01:56:44.199
Eat a dick, Brian. Get the fuck
out my house. Y'all done here.

01:56:45.240 --> 01:56:46.799
Can we cut, please?

01:58:01.320 --> 01:58:04.597
Yeah. I'm just waiting on my friend.
I should've drove.

01:58:04.720 --> 01:58:08.316
- You're not havin' a good time?
- No, no. No, I had a really good time.

01:58:08.400 --> 01:58:11.359
But now it's starting
to get a little wild.

01:58:11.440 --> 01:58:14.239
Yeah. We've been known
to get crazy from time to time.

01:58:16.480 --> 01:58:19.678
- I'm Andre.
- I'm Nicole.

01:58:21.400 --> 01:58:24.598
Come on, man. Lighten up.

01:58:25.200 --> 01:58:28.113
We're about to get back in the game.
Big time.

01:58:28.200 --> 01:58:30.431
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:58:30.520 --> 01:58:32.432
How do you figure?

01:58:32.520 --> 01:58:36.434
Are you trying to piss me off?
Come on. God almighty.

01:58:36.520 --> 01:58:38.432
Did you forget about Ren's new album?

01:58:38.520 --> 01:58:42.434
Or did you forget about the fact
that you are working on something

01:58:42.520 --> 01:58:45.513
I think is gonna be bigger
than anything N.W.A ever did.

01:58:45.600 --> 01:58:47.478
All I know... Mm!

01:58:49.040 --> 01:58:51.680

01:58:51.760 --> 01:58:54.719
- Doing it big. Making movies and shit.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:58:54.800 --> 01:58:57.076
Then I keep hearing about this album
Dre about to drop.

01:58:57.160 --> 01:59:00.119
Dre is a fucking producer, Eric.

01:59:00.200 --> 01:59:02.271
Producers don't rap.

01:59:02.360 --> 01:59:05.114
We have him under contract.
He can't do anything.

01:59:05.240 --> 01:59:07.436
Cheer up.

01:59:07.520 --> 01:59:09.591
Eat, drink and be merry.

- How you doin'?
- All right.

01:59:12.880 --> 01:59:14.473
Jimmy Lovine, Interscope Records.

01:59:14.560 --> 01:59:16.358
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

01:59:16.440 --> 01:59:19.274
So, what do I call you?
Dre? Dr. Dre? Doc?

01:59:19.360 --> 01:59:21.113
Nah, Dre is cool.

01:59:21.200 --> 01:59:23.192
- Go ahead. Have a seat.
- All right.

01:59:23.280 --> 01:59:24.509
- It's good.
- Yeah.

01:59:24.600 --> 01:59:27.877
- So, what do you got today?
- Um...

01:59:27.960 --> 01:59:29.314
Well, you know.

01:59:29.400 --> 01:59:32.871
I heard John McClain gave you my album.

01:59:32.960 --> 01:59:37.239
- What'd you think?
- I think it was great.

01:59:37.320 --> 01:59:41.030
So, you're the artist on the record.
Who produced it?

01:59:42.080 --> 01:59:45.676
- I did.
- Okay. And who mixed it?

01:59:45.760 --> 01:59:48.639
Hey, come on, man. I did.

01:59:49.320 --> 01:59:50.640
Huh.

01:59:51.680 --> 01:59:54.752
Listen. I don't know
anything about hip-hop,

01:59:54.920 --> 01:59:56.877
but I know that this is special.

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:58.593
Seriously.

02:00:00.040 --> 02:00:01.554
Thank you.

02:00:01.640 --> 02:00:05.395
Look, we'd love to bring in Interscope,
but there's a little problem.

02:00:05.480 --> 02:00:08.075
- What's the problem?
- Ruthless.

02:00:08.160 --> 02:00:11.756
Lawsuits and contracts.

02:00:11.840 --> 02:00:13.752
Well, how about this?

02:00:13.840 --> 02:00:16.514
You give me three weeks,
and I don't wanna hear any bullshit...

02:00:16.600 --> 02:00:18.273
about you shopping this
anywhere around town.

02:00:18.360 --> 02:00:20.750
If you do that,

02:00:20.840 --> 02:00:24.311
I believe I can solve your problem
with the contract.

02:00:28.680 --> 02:00:30.512
Lil' nigga, you in my spot?

02:00:31.920 --> 02:00:33.673
- Yo.
- Hey, Suge.

02:00:33.760 --> 02:00:36.753
- Suge. Easy, man, yo...
- Hey, Suge, what the...

02:00:36.840 --> 02:00:39.309
- Hey, Suge.
- You parked in my motherfuckin' spot or what?

02:00:39.400 --> 02:00:41.517
- I didn't... I didn't know, man.
- It's cool.

02:00:41.600 --> 02:00:43.193
You little fuck!

02:00:43.280 --> 02:00:44.430
Suge!

02:00:46.960 --> 02:00:49.316
- Suge, it's just a parking spot.
- Get off of me!

02:00:49.400 --> 02:00:51.039
Come on!

02:00:54.360 --> 02:00:56.556

02:00:58.200 --> 02:01:00.556
And park my car.

02:01:00.640 --> 02:01:03.109

on that motherfucker.

02:04:40.760 --> 02:04:42.558
You know what, Jerry?

02:04:43.840 --> 02:04:45.433
You right.

02:04:45.520 --> 02:04:48.354
You absolutely fuckin' right.

02:04:48.440 --> 02:04:50.796
We got business to take care of.

02:04:51.680 --> 02:04:53.797
I'll see you in a minute.

02:05:02.560 --> 02:05:04.392
You all right?

02:05:05.800 --> 02:05:07.280
E, are you cool?

02:05:09.640 --> 02:05:11.791
Eric.

02:05:17.960 --> 02:05:22.193
"You got knocked the fuck out. "

02:05:25.360 --> 02:05:26.635
That shit is funny.

02:05:26.720 --> 02:05:27.949

I'm feeling it though.

02:05:33.040 --> 02:05:35.396
Hmm. What page are you on?

02:05:35.560 --> 02:05:37.040
100.

02:05:37.120 --> 02:05:38.918
I'm not going too much longer though.

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:40.878

02:05:55.880 --> 02:05:58.111

contracts, whatever it is,

02:06:48.680 --> 02:06:50.512

You just go to New York.

02:07:06.360 --> 02:07:11.116
You take care of this big ol'
distribution deal with Sony.

02:07:11.200 --> 02:07:13.795
Bring that shit on in.

02:07:13.880 --> 02:07:15.792
All right?

02:07:15.880 --> 02:07:17.951
And I'll check into everything else.

02:07:22.320 --> 02:07:23.800
I love you.

02:07:23.880 --> 02:07:26.190
- You what?
- I love you.

02:07:26.280 --> 02:07:28.397
You what?

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:33.719
So how's your home life, man?

02:07:34.760 --> 02:07:38.037
What? That small-ass house I just
moved into in Norwalk?

02:07:38.120 --> 02:07:39.440
Fuckin' hate it.

02:07:39.520 --> 02:07:41.591
No, come on. You know what I mean.

02:07:41.680 --> 02:07:44.593
I mean your love life, Eric.
Hmm?

02:07:45.880 --> 02:07:47.917
You seem pretty serious
about this girl.

02:07:48.480 --> 02:07:52.190
- I ain't in love.
- Oh? You had me scared there for a minute.

02:07:52.280 --> 02:07:55.910
- You're too young to settle down.
- You don't have to be scared of that.

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.356
Oh, man. Wait till you taste this.

02:07:58.480 --> 02:08:00.676
Kung pao chicken.

02:08:00.760 --> 02:08:04.436
Fantastic.
And it is better the second day.

02:08:05.160 --> 02:08:06.719
There you go.

02:08:07.240 --> 02:08:08.799
Dig in.

02:08:11.280 --> 02:08:14.398
So, where is this girl from, again?

02:08:16.680 --> 02:08:20.310
Look, Jerry.
I actually ate right before I came.

02:08:20.400 --> 02:08:23.040
So I'm just gonna take this and go.

02:08:23.120 --> 02:08:25.271
Hold on. Hold on.
Where are you going?

02:08:25.960 --> 02:08:27.758
I just came to get this.

02:08:27.840 --> 02:08:30.071
These are my bills, my checks.

02:08:30.160 --> 02:08:32.152
Look, I'm gonna have a bite
of your food.

02:08:33.880 --> 02:08:35.633
I'm gonna say farewell.

02:08:38.800 --> 02:08:40.792
I'll talk to you later.

02:08:51.080 --> 02:08:53.515
Your neighbors,
they've been complaining a lot.

02:08:53.600 --> 02:08:56.559
- About the noise.
- Stop.

02:08:56.640 --> 02:08:59.838
Man, I just think
a little privacy would be better.

02:08:59.960 --> 02:09:02.839
So what? You want me to move?

02:09:04.400 --> 02:09:05.595
Yeah.

02:09:05.680 --> 02:09:08.991
And I... You know,
I happen to know of a place.

02:09:09.080 --> 02:09:11.834
There's plenty of room,
and I know the owner.

02:09:13.760 --> 02:09:15.672
Are you sure
you're ready for that, Andre?

02:09:15.760 --> 02:09:17.991
Yeah, I am.

02:09:18.080 --> 02:09:20.834
'Cause I'm really feeling you like that.

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.435
I'm really feeling you too.

02:09:26.680 --> 02:09:28.000
But...

02:09:34.040 --> 02:09:38.080
Hey, don't even worry about it.
It was just a thought.

02:09:41.800 --> 02:09:43.439
What's up?

02:09:43.520 --> 02:09:46.433
All right. Good night.

02:09:46.520 --> 02:09:48.955
Oh, whoa, whoa. Really?

02:09:49.040 --> 02:09:50.918
- Good night?
- You okay to drive?

02:09:52.880 --> 02:09:55.395
No. Look at you.

02:09:55.480 --> 02:09:59.076
- Good night, Andre.
- Nah. See...

02:09:59.160 --> 02:10:02.756
See, I can't help thinking maybe
you want me to come inside.

02:10:02.840 --> 02:10:06.993
- Of course I do.
- So, what's different now? Huh?

02:10:07.080 --> 02:10:09.834
I got a lot to think about.

02:10:09.920 --> 02:10:14.358
You're asking me to move in with you.
That is a huge step.

02:10:14.440 --> 02:10:18.912
I like you, Andre,
but there's a lot going on around you.

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:20.639
What you mean?

02:10:21.720 --> 02:10:24.360
I know about the whole
Death Row business...

02:10:24.440 --> 02:10:27.274
the assault charges, the shooting.

02:10:27.360 --> 02:10:29.591
Just seems dangerous.

02:10:29.680 --> 02:10:32.514

02:17:27.280 --> 02:17:29.351
How you feel? You good?

02:17:29.440 --> 02:17:30.954
Hell, yeah, nigga, I'm good.

02:17:31.040 --> 02:17:33.191
- It's good to see you.
- That's what I'm talkin' about, Eric.

02:17:33.280 --> 02:17:36.512
- It's good to see you right now.
- Look at you!

02:17:36.640 --> 02:17:39.439
Pull your fuckin' homies off me
then if it's good to see me.

02:17:39.560 --> 02:17:42.837
- You had niggas jump us.
- Goddamn!

02:17:42.920 --> 02:17:45.640
How you go from selling rocks
in the dope house...

02:17:45.720 --> 02:17:48.155
to having dinner in the White House
with the president?

02:17:48.240 --> 02:17:50.550
They still trying
to figure that shit out.

02:17:52.320 --> 02:17:54.676
But, hey, all publicity...

02:17:54.760 --> 02:17:56.638
Is good publicity.

02:17:56.720 --> 02:17:58.951
- You know it.
- You know that's right.

02:17:59.080 --> 02:18:02.630
Man. Look, man, I...

02:18:02.720 --> 02:18:05.872
I wish that dumb shit really would've
never popped off between us.

02:18:05.960 --> 02:18:08.077
We shouldn't have dissed each other
in the first place.

02:18:08.160 --> 02:18:11.392
Making the fans choose between us?
That wasn't cool.

02:18:12.480 --> 02:18:13.994
You right.

02:18:15.920 --> 02:18:19.152
- You ever think we'd be that big though?
- Hell no.

02:18:19.240 --> 02:18:22.517
I was just talking to my wife about that...
how it was in the beginning.

02:18:22.640 --> 02:18:25.519
- Yeah.
- Shit, we just wanted to do music for the neighborhood.

02:18:25.600 --> 02:18:27.512
Be ghetto stars.

02:18:27.600 --> 02:18:31.514
But what if we had
the chance to find out...

02:18:31.600 --> 02:18:33.080
how big we could really be?

02:18:33.160 --> 02:18:35.391
Come on, man, you got my mind workin'.

02:18:35.480 --> 02:18:37.995
I be thinking
about that shit all the time.

02:18:38.120 --> 02:18:41.113
If we could just take that shit back
to '89. We changed the world.

02:18:41.200 --> 02:18:44.034
I hear you.
It was a simpler time, you know?

02:18:44.120 --> 02:18:46.874
It was hard then. But I've had days...

02:18:46.960 --> 02:18:49.873
where I almost wish
we was gettin' arrested in Detroit again.

02:18:49.960 --> 02:18:51.519
Shit. You know?

02:18:51.600 --> 02:18:53.956
Shit ain't gotta stop there.

02:18:54.040 --> 02:18:57.954
But if we go do this,
we gotta do it right.

02:18:58.040 --> 02:19:00.760
And if Dre with it, I'm with it.

02:19:00.840 --> 02:19:03.958
But I don't know
your relationship with dude.

02:19:04.040 --> 02:19:07.477
But if you want me, Eric,
Jerry can't be there.

02:19:12.040 --> 02:19:14.953
All right.

02:19:15.040 --> 02:19:18.556
Hey, man.

02:19:18.640 --> 02:19:20.552
- Shit.
- It's 'cause you ain't got them damn gloves on.

02:19:20.640 --> 02:19:23.155
Man, whatever.

02:19:23.240 --> 02:19:24.879
But I hear you.

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:26.514
Yeah?

02:19:27.640 --> 02:19:30.280
- You said it.
- All right.

02:19:30.360 --> 02:19:33.478
These invoices haven't been paid.

02:19:33.560 --> 02:19:35.631
They're two or three years outdated.

02:19:35.760 --> 02:19:38.673
These are canceled checks.
They all bounced.

02:19:38.760 --> 02:19:40.911
And these are past due.

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:44.437
Jerry took advantage of you.

02:19:44.560 --> 02:19:49.157
I know it's a lot,
but you had to know the truth sometime.

02:19:49.240 --> 02:19:50.720
Now you do.

02:19:52.680 --> 02:19:56.356
You know, Dre and Cube
tried to warn me about this.

02:19:57.920 --> 02:20:00.674
I've been fuckin' up for a long time.

02:20:04.920 --> 02:20:06.434
Don't. Don't.

02:20:06.520 --> 02:20:08.477
A really long time.

02:20:11.600 --> 02:20:13.876
Shit.

02:20:31.720 --> 02:20:33.677
Hey, man.

02:20:36.720 --> 02:20:38.712
Where you been?

02:20:38.800 --> 02:20:41.031
I've been calling you all day.

02:20:42.600 --> 02:20:44.557
Sit down, Jerry.

02:20:48.480 --> 02:20:51.154
What is this all about?
Uh, the groupie?

02:20:51.240 --> 02:20:53.709
The executive assistant?

02:20:55.080 --> 02:20:57.231
She even go to college?

02:20:57.320 --> 02:21:00.358
Man, you're so much fucking
smarter than this.

02:21:00.440 --> 02:21:01.920
Sit down, Jerry.

02:21:22.840 --> 02:21:25.196
This ain't about Tomica, Jerry.

02:21:26.280 --> 02:21:27.839
This about you.

02:21:27.920 --> 02:21:29.912
And you can stop acting like you
ain't never done nothin' wrong.

02:21:30.040 --> 02:21:32.430
You know what, man?
I know that you're upset.

02:21:32.520 --> 02:21:34.034
I understand.

02:21:35.200 --> 02:21:36.953
But I'm asking you...

02:21:37.040 --> 02:21:39.077
I'm advising you,
take a breath, okay?

02:21:39.160 --> 02:21:40.958
I'm gonna look at the paperwork, Eric.

02:21:41.040 --> 02:21:44.636
- You can stop giving me advice as of now.
- It's fucked up.

02:21:45.960 --> 02:21:47.440
Here's what's about to happen.

02:21:47.560 --> 02:21:49.392
I'm-a get N.W.A back together,

02:21:49.520 --> 02:21:52.274
and you ain't gonna have
nothin' to do with it this time.

02:21:54.400 --> 02:21:56.437
How the fuck can you even
say something like that?

02:21:56.520 --> 02:21:59.558
What the fuck
is going on with you, man?

02:21:59.640 --> 02:22:01.632
I know what's good for you.

02:22:01.720 --> 02:22:03.632
I know what's good for Ruthless.

02:22:03.720 --> 02:22:07.396
And we have worked up a trust
after years of hard work.

02:22:07.480 --> 02:22:09.312
And that trust is our foundation, Eric.

02:22:09.400 --> 02:22:12.393
I don't give a shit. Eric.

02:22:15.080 --> 02:22:18.198
You look lousy, man. Are you okay?

02:22:19.040 --> 02:22:20.474
Trust?

02:22:21.640 --> 02:22:23.836
Trust is a motherfucker.

02:22:25.160 --> 02:22:26.753
Is it?

02:22:26.840 --> 02:22:29.309
Let me ask you something.

02:22:29.400 --> 02:22:31.995
Eric, if what I'm doing is so illegal,

02:22:32.080 --> 02:22:34.072
how come I've never
been sued, hmm?

02:22:34.160 --> 02:22:37.836
If I'm such a fucking thief,
such a liar, such a motherfucker,

02:22:37.920 --> 02:22:40.071
how come nobody's
ever come to collect?

02:22:40.160 --> 02:22:43.915
Because this is business,
and this is how it works.

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.276
And it's not always pretty. No.

02:22:46.360 --> 02:22:50.195
Do I cover my own ass?
Do I cover my own end? Absolutely.

02:22:50.280 --> 02:22:54.274
But don't you dare fucking tell me
that I have not taken care of you.

02:22:54.360 --> 02:22:55.953
Don't you fucking tell me...

02:22:56.040 --> 02:22:58.874
that I have not
had your back from day one!

02:22:58.960 --> 02:23:00.679
Day one!

02:23:05.120 --> 02:23:07.680
Is this taking care of me?

02:23:07.760 --> 02:23:09.353
Are you fucking kidding me?

02:23:09.440 --> 02:23:11.193
It's taking care
of the whole fucking thing.

02:23:11.280 --> 02:23:14.273
It's business! And this is how it works.

02:23:14.360 --> 02:23:17.956
Have I covered my end?
Do I cover my ass? Absolutely.

02:23:18.040 --> 02:23:22.557
But don't you dare fucking tell me
that I have not taken care of you.

02:23:24.080 --> 02:23:25.799
This business too?

02:23:25.880 --> 02:23:27.394
Yes. This is business.

02:23:27.480 --> 02:23:29.039
This is how fucked up it can get.

02:23:29.160 --> 02:23:32.232
But I didn't start this.
I didn't fuck it up.

02:23:32.320 --> 02:23:33.754
You did!

02:23:35.400 --> 02:23:36.880
No.

02:23:38.560 --> 02:23:40.233
You did.

02:23:41.920 --> 02:23:43.320
You fired, Jerry.

02:23:43.400 --> 02:23:44.993
Oh, for Christ...

02:23:45.080 --> 02:23:46.878
Eric, this isn't how we do things.

02:23:46.960 --> 02:23:50.840
This is not you.
This is not you. Eric!

02:23:52.240 --> 02:23:53.879
This is an important company.

02:23:53.960 --> 02:23:56.759
Eric, I'm not gonna let you fuck this up.

02:23:56.840 --> 02:23:58.718
Eric?

02:23:58.800 --> 02:24:01.076
Oh, for Christ's sake! Eric!

02:24:12.920 --> 02:24:14.673
<i>Yeah, hello?</i>

02:24:14.760 --> 02:24:16.433
Yeah, what up, Dre?

02:24:16.520 --> 02:24:18.352
<i>- Who this?
- Eric.</i>

02:24:18.440 --> 02:24:21.353
<i>- E?
- Just felt like calling.</i>

02:24:21.440 --> 02:24:24.353
<i>Yeah. Okay.</i>

02:24:24.440 --> 02:24:25.954
What's up?

02:24:26.040 --> 02:24:28.760
<i>I mean, you know me, man.
Doing my thing.</i>

02:24:28.840 --> 02:24:31.196
Killin' all this pussy.

02:24:32.640 --> 02:24:34.757
<i>- How about you?
- You know, man.</i>

02:24:34.920 --> 02:24:36.832
I'm just making tracks,
doing my thing.

02:24:36.920 --> 02:24:40.231
Yeah, that Snoop joint you did
was crazy. That was dope.

02:24:40.320 --> 02:24:45.076
Yeah? Thanks, E.
Good looking out, man.

02:24:48.640 --> 02:24:50.472
Look, Dre, I know you be busy,

02:24:50.560 --> 02:24:55.430
but, um, I talked to Cube,
and we were talking about some...

02:24:55.520 --> 02:24:57.273
some possibilities.

02:24:58.800 --> 02:25:01.076
Possibilities? Okay.

02:25:01.160 --> 02:25:05.074
Yeah, like, without Jerry Heller type
of fucking possibilities.

02:25:05.160 --> 02:25:07.470
Really? Well, it's about time.

02:25:07.560 --> 02:25:09.995
Man, I mean,
I know shit kinda went crazy.

02:25:10.080 --> 02:25:11.878
And...

02:25:11.960 --> 02:25:15.670
You know, the money
kinda had everybody divided, man,

02:25:15.760 --> 02:25:19.151
but... I really wish it didn't.

02:25:23.840 --> 02:25:25.672
It's, uh...

02:25:25.760 --> 02:25:29.595
To be honest, man, I'm not proud
of all the shit I did either.

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:38.391
So, what you think, man?
You think we could get together, or what?

02:25:38.480 --> 02:25:39.914
What you think?

02:25:43.440 --> 02:25:45.113
Yeah, man.

02:25:46.040 --> 02:25:47.838
Yeah, that sound good.

02:25:49.120 --> 02:25:51.077
Let's do it, E. Let's do it.

02:25:51.160 --> 02:25:54.232
<i>I'm-a let you know when we can
get back into the studio, you know.</i>

02:25:54.320 --> 02:25:57.199
Lay down some tracks, like the old days.

02:25:59.640 --> 02:26:02.109
<i>- Fair enough.
- All right.</i>

02:26:02.200 --> 02:26:04.840
It's good to hear from you, man.

02:26:06.960 --> 02:26:08.440
All right.

02:26:22.400 --> 02:26:26.155
<i>Hip-hop]</i>

02:26:39.240 --> 02:26:41.596
<i>Man, y'all niggas ain't making no music in here.</i>

02:26:41.680 --> 02:26:43.751
- Hey!

02:26:43.840 --> 02:26:45.320
What's up? What up?
What up? What up?

02:26:45.440 --> 02:26:48.478
Yo, hey, when are Dre and Cube

02:26:48.600 --> 02:26:51.160
- I'm ready!
- Yeah, man. 'Cause I'm ready to get this new shit going.

02:26:51.280 --> 02:26:52.760
I'm ready too.

02:26:52.840 --> 02:26:55.992
But long as we stay ready,
we gonna know we gonna be on, man.

02:26:56.080 --> 02:26:58.800
Y'all already know

02:26:58.880 --> 02:27:01.475
- Here ya go, baby.

02:27:01.560 --> 02:27:04.359
- I got libraries of new shit.
- That's what I'm talking about, Ren.

02:27:04.440 --> 02:27:06.033
That's what I'm talking about.

02:27:06.120 --> 02:27:08.635
<i>I got the tracks. You like that?</i>

02:27:08.720 --> 02:27:12.316
Mm-hmm. Hell, yeah.

02:27:12.400 --> 02:27:14.631
You think you Dre now?

02:27:14.760 --> 02:27:16.592
I'm trying to murder Dre.

02:27:16.720 --> 02:27:19.792
I'm about to murder both of y'all
on the track though. Check me out.

02:27:19.880 --> 02:27:21.678
- Check me out.
- What you doing, E?

02:27:21.760 --> 02:27:23.911
You know you don't play no instruments.

02:27:27.280 --> 02:27:29.033
You gonna play it?

02:27:31.400 --> 02:27:32.993
E, you all right?

02:27:33.880 --> 02:27:35.394
Eric.

02:27:36.480 --> 02:27:38.199
Baby, you good?

02:27:39.320 --> 02:27:40.515
Yeah.

02:27:40.600 --> 02:27:43.832
- I'm all right.
- You sure?

02:27:45.560 --> 02:27:47.199
Eric! Eric!

02:27:47.280 --> 02:27:48.794
- Call 911.
- Eric!

02:27:48.920 --> 02:27:51.071
- Eric. Get up, man.
- Baby?

02:27:51.160 --> 02:27:52.992
Yo, call 911. Call 911.

02:27:53.080 --> 02:27:55.515
- You all right, E?
- Baby? Eric? Eric.

02:27:55.600 --> 02:27:57.831
- Eazy, wake up.
- Eric, baby!

02:27:57.920 --> 02:28:00.389
- Open your eyes.
- Yes, we need an ambulance.

02:28:10.240 --> 02:28:12.072
Um...

02:28:15.640 --> 02:28:19.236
Wait. Ain't you gonna
say something?

02:28:19.320 --> 02:28:22.392
What is it? A respiratory
infection? Pneumonia? What?

02:28:22.480 --> 02:28:26.520
Yes, well, um,
it is those things and more, I'm afraid.

02:28:26.600 --> 02:28:28.671
We ran a full blood battery.

02:28:28.760 --> 02:28:31.229
And, uh...

02:28:31.320 --> 02:28:35.792
I'm sorry, Mr. Wright,
but, uh, you've tested positive for HIV.

02:28:37.600 --> 02:28:39.956
- Get the fuck outta here.
- Wha-Wha-What?

02:28:40.040 --> 02:28:44.034
A normal T-cell count
is anywhere between 500 and 1500.

02:28:44.120 --> 02:28:46.191
Right now, your T-cell count is 14.

02:28:51.040 --> 02:28:52.713
But I ain't no faggot.

02:28:52.800 --> 02:28:56.555
Mr. Wright, actually, um, the virus can be
transmitted in quite a few ways,

02:28:56.640 --> 02:28:59.712
including unprotected heterosexual sex.

02:29:03.960 --> 02:29:05.758
Uh... That's wrong.

02:29:05.840 --> 02:29:08.639
You-You gotta test that over.
That's... Test that again.

02:29:08.720 --> 02:29:11.474
We've run the test five times
with five different samples,

02:29:11.560 --> 02:29:13.233
- and the result remains the same.
- Shit!

02:29:13.320 --> 02:29:14.310
Tomica.

02:29:16.520 --> 02:29:18.000
Tomica.

02:29:18.080 --> 02:29:20.993
But she's pregnant, Doc.
What this mean?

02:29:21.080 --> 02:29:24.437
It doesn't necessarily mean
that she's contracted the virus.

02:29:24.520 --> 02:29:27.240
But, uh, we have to test her to be sure.

02:29:27.320 --> 02:29:29.915
So, what do we do?
What... When we start the treatment?

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.640
I mean, what... I gotta get healthy.

02:29:32.720 --> 02:29:36.157
I got things to do. I got...

02:29:36.240 --> 02:29:38.277
Wha-What are we supposed to do?

02:29:38.360 --> 02:29:39.919
Mr. Wright.

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:43.072
You need to understand
that you are very, very sick.

02:29:43.200 --> 02:29:46.830
But I don't even feel that bad, Doc.
Don't tell me that. Don't tell me that.

02:29:46.920 --> 02:29:48.434
With care and palliative care,

02:29:48.520 --> 02:29:50.273
we can probably keep you comfortable...

02:29:50.360 --> 02:29:53.432
for, uh, maybe six months,
at the very most.

02:29:53.520 --> 02:29:57.036
Comfortable?
What do you mean, comfortable?

02:30:00.600 --> 02:30:02.319
It's just a matter of time.

02:30:04.240 --> 02:30:08.837
I am... I'm truly, truly sorry, Mr. Wright.

02:30:08.920 --> 02:30:12.675
I'll-I'll leave you time to, um, process this.

02:30:15.200 --> 02:30:17.635
Come on, Doc. Come on, Doc. No.

02:30:17.720 --> 02:30:19.313
Doc.

02:30:31.240 --> 02:30:33.038

02:30:53.600 --> 02:30:55.432

02:41:49.120 --> 02:41:51.430
<i>Damn, that shit was dope!</i>

02:42:04.960 --> 02:42:07.634
<i># I just need y'all
to bear with me for a minute #</i>

02:42:07.720 --> 02:42:10.872
<i># While I talk
about the pages of my diary #</i>

02:42:10.960 --> 02:42:13.634
<i># Yeah
Listen up #</i>

02:42:13.720 --> 02:42:16.633
<i># Uhh, I remember
when I got started #</i>

02:42:16.720 --> 02:42:18.200
<i># My intention was to win #</i>

02:42:18.280 --> 02:42:20.078
<i># But a lot of shit changed
since then #</i>

02:42:20.160 --> 02:42:23.551
<i># Some more friends became enemies
in the quest of victory #</i>

02:42:23.640 --> 02:42:26.394
<i># But I made a vow
Never let this shit get to me #</i>

02:42:26.480 --> 02:42:29.996
<i># I let it pass, so I consider
that part of my history #</i>

02:42:30.080 --> 02:42:32.914
<i># And I'm strong
financially, physically #</i>

02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:35.674
<i># Mentally I'm
on a whole another level #</i>

02:42:35.760 --> 02:42:38.320
<i># And don't forget
that I came from the ghetto #</i>

02:42:38.400 --> 02:42:40.915
<i># Sold a new house for my moms
That's special #</i>

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:43.720
<i># I let you going shopping
till your feet get tired #</i>

02:42:43.800 --> 02:42:47.077
<i># Then a new Benz
just for you to ride in #</i>

02:42:47.160 --> 02:42:49.880
<i>- # When I didn't have it, you provided #
- # You provided #</i>

02:42:49.960 --> 02:42:52.520
<i># Don't be surprised
that I built an enterprise #</i>

02:42:52.600 --> 02:42:56.514
<i># And my house got a view
of the city like a high-rise #</i>

02:42:56.600 --> 02:43:01.117
<i># I'm just talking to my diary #</i>

02:43:01.200 --> 02:43:03.874
<i># When I open up my book
I think about the world later #</i>

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:06.879
<i># No ink in the pen
No lines on the paper #</i>

02:43:06.960 --> 02:43:12.513
<i># I'm just, I'm just
I'm just talking to my diary #</i>

02:43:12.600 --> 02:43:15.240
<i># Sometimes when I got
a lot of shit on my mind #</i>

02:43:15.320 --> 02:43:18.233
<i># I'm just starin' at the sky
You probably thinkin' I'm high #</i>

02:43:18.320 --> 02:43:23.952
<i># I'm just, I'm just
I'm just talking to my diary #</i>

02:43:24.040 --> 02:43:27.192
<i># Now puff, puff, pass that
A nigga having flashbacks #</i>

02:43:27.280 --> 02:43:29.476
<i># I remember
how it used to be #</i>

02:43:29.560 --> 02:43:32.758
<i># Now my money like NASDAQ
My checks you can cash that #</i>

02:43:32.840 --> 02:43:34.797
<i># I remember
how it used to be #</i>

02:43:34.880 --> 02:43:36.872
<i># I used to be
a starving artist #</i>

02:43:36.960 --> 02:43:38.758
<i># So I would never
starve an artist #</i>

02:43:38.840 --> 02:43:41.560
<i># This is my passion
It's where my heart is #</i>

02:43:41.640 --> 02:43:44.553
<i># It gets the hardest
when I think about the dearly departed #</i>

02:43:44.640 --> 02:43:46.313
<i># Like the nigga
I started with #</i>

02:43:46.400 --> 02:43:49.791
<i># I know Eazy can see me now
looking down through the clouds #</i>

02:43:49.920 --> 02:43:52.560
<i># And regardless,
I know my nigga still proud #</i>

02:43:52.640 --> 02:43:55.314
<i># It's been a while since we spoke
but you still my folks #</i>

02:43:55.400 --> 02:43:57.551
<i># We used to sit back,
laugh and joke #</i>

02:43:57.680 --> 02:44:00.320
<i># Now, I remember when we
used to do all-nighters #</i>

02:44:00.400 --> 02:44:03.393
<i># You in the booth and Cube
in the corner writing #</i>

02:44:03.520 --> 02:44:06.115
<i># Where Ren at?
Shout out to my nigga Yella #</i>

02:44:06.200 --> 02:44:07.793
<i># Damn, I miss that #</i>

02:44:07.880 --> 02:44:10.440
<i># Shit, a nigga
having flashbacks #</i>

02:44:10.520 --> 02:44:12.751
<i># When I open up my book
I think about the world later #</i>

02:44:12.840 --> 02:44:15.594
<i># No ink in the pen
No lines on the paper #</i>

02:44:15.680 --> 02:44:21.312
<i># I'm just, I'm just
I'm just talking to my diary #</i>

02:44:21.400 --> 02:44:24.040
<i># Sometimes when I got
a lot of shit on my mind #</i>

02:44:24.120 --> 02:44:27.158
